# Single User Dungeon Game

## Why I've created this project?
It's a variation of simple dungeon game engine I created few years ago to teach my students (age 12+) OOP in Python. For GIT release I've added some additional Python syntax like list comprehension, try .. except, variable properties and unit tests, but you can freely remove/simplify it to make the code easier to understand.

In this release I didn't use any DB as my primary goal was to focus on Python code examples, however if you want to use it for your own project ideas - it should be easy to adapt a simple DB to store room descriptions and players' state.

## How to play?
In order to run this game you just need to launch 'main.py' file.
Movement: north/south/east/west
Write 'quit' if you want to finish.

Enjoy!
