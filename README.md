# Single User Dungeon Game

It's a simple text game to have some fun with classes. I wrote this game just to explain the basic concepts of OOP to my students (age 12+), however every time I write it it's slightly different, as different class students have different ideas how to modify the game. :)

I know it would be much more functional with some DB included, but it was not the goal of this project (however one of my pupils rewrote this concept to MySQL DB and created true multiplayer game - that was total badass :)).
